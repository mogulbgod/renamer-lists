This was made from data used in the LandSandBoat FFXI Server Emulator and is accurate there but specifically accurate to the CatsEyeXi Private Server.

Add the file to the 'Ashita\config\addons\renamer' folder for your install.
Load the Renamer addon (/addon load renamer)
Once loaded type '/renamer' to open the UI.
Click the List tab.
Click the Refresh List button
